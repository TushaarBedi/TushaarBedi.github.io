   <h3>Why, you may ask, should Tushaar be your best friend?</h3>
   <p>First of all, you cannot have too many best friends. Well, you should not have more than you can fit in your car.
       Or if you do, make sure the overflow fits in a second car. You don't want ONE too many friends
       because that is a lonely drive home from the movie for the "extra" friend.
